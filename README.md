## BurguerKenzie

#### Project made during my course at Kenzie Academy Brasil that I implemented more techs to practice!
#### It is a hamburguer e-commerce, the API used was a fake api that I created to practice my Front-End skills. You can add the product on the cart, make the checkout paying by credit card, debit card or by pix(payment method like Venmo but in Brazil). 

##### Used Techs:

###### #react    #typeScript    #css    #html    #chakraUi    #jwtDecode    #axios 
###### #styledComponents    #mobileFirst    #router-dom    #react-stripe-js 
###### #contextApi    #materialUi    #javascript    #yup
