Project made during my course at Kenzie Academy Brasil that I implemented more techs to practice! It is a hamburguer e-commerce, the API used was a fake api that I created using json-server fake API. You can add the product on the cart, checkout, pay by credit card, debit card or by pix(payment method like Venmo). 

##### Used Techs:

#react    #typeScript    #css    #html    #chakraUi    #jwtDecode    #axios 
#styledComponents    #mobileFirst    #router-dom    #react-stripe-js 
#contextApi    #materialUi    #javascript    #yup
