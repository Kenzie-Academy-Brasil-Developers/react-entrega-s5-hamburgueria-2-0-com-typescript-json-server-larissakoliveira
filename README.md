<p align="center">Mobile-first project made during my course at Kenzie Academy Brasil that I implemented more techs to practice! It is a hamburguer e-commerce, the API used was a fake api that I created using json-server fake API. You can add the product on the cart, checkout, pay by credit card, debit card or by pix(payment method like Venmo). </p>
